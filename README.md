# Interactive Form #
 
Unit 3 Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

In this project I have created an Interactive Form for a conference registration using Javascript. Using Regex, the users name, email and credit card details are all validated. Error messages/hints are displayed when incorrect information is submitted. 

Areas where I exceeded expectations: 

* I have added a real time error message in the Name input whenever the user enters an invalid character eg a digit or a special character.
* Added functionality which prevents users from registering for conflicting activities.
* Added functionality in the Card Number input so that a seperate message is shown depending on whether the number submitted is too short or too long.
